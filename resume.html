<h4><b><u><i>APPLIED PROJECTS:</i></u></b></h4>
<ul>
<li>S.M.A.R.T APPLICATION FOR EFFECTIVE BLOOD MONITORING:</li>
<p>The motto of this app is to make sure that the blood stored in the blood bank never gets exhausted. 
Therefore, patients get blood at the time of their need without any delay. If in case there arises any situation where the blood level in the blood bank is low, 
the donors will be automatically notified via text messages or through pop up notifications in the app </p>
<li>SMART HOME:</li>
<p>This aim of the project was to construct a smart home that has an automated control system that conserves prime energy resources like water and electricity. 
This is an IoT project, thus the data obtained from individual devices are fed to the cloud for storage and data analytics purposes </p>
<li>WIRELESS ROBO-RESCUER:</li>
<p>Designed a real time semi-autonomous surveillance and rescue robot utilizing a Virtual Instrumentation Interface (NI-LabVIEW) on an Arduino platform incorporated on a PIC microcontroller. 
Here, the signals were commuted using a X-bee protocol and we also had an IP camera affixed to it for surveillance purpose</p>
